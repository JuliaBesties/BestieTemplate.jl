  help: Pre-commit (Whether to add pre-commit.org. It runs before every commit fixing your formatting and preventing bad practices)
  description: |
    Pre-commit runs several "hooks" whenever you make a commit. These hooks mostly fall into these categories:
    - Formatters: Not only JuliaFormatter, but also formatters for Markdown, TOML, YAML, and JSON files.
    - Linters: Analyze the code to prevent "bad" things. Sometimes includes formatting rules, but frequently useful for what falls outside formatting, but leads to poor code performance or possible pitfalls. In Julia, JET would be a candidate for this, although we don't have any Julia linters in the pre-commit hooks (yet).
    - Quality of Life checks: Prevents commits if you have `.rej` files, if you are on the main branch, if you forget a git merge marker, etc.
    Many pre-commit hooks are also available as editor plugins, and could be run continually in your editor, although we don't have a list for that (yet).

  description: |
    Determines the testing approach and infrastructure generated for your package.

    The `basic` option generates a simple @testset-based test with a single test file, suitable for small packages.

    The `testitem_cli` option provides the most advanced testing setup using TestItems.jl with a full command-line interface that supports filtering by tags, file names, and test patterns. This is ideal for larger projects with complex test suites.

    The `testitem_basic` option uses TestItems.jl with simple @run_package_tests, providing better test organization than basic @testset without the CLI complexity.

    The `basic_auto_discover` option automatically discovers and includes all test-*.jl files in @testsets, encouraging test file organization while maintaining the traditional @testset approach.

  default: "exclude_all_qualified_accesses_are_public"
  description: |
    ExplicitImports performs various checks. Some depend on the imported
    packages fixing the definition of public API to Julia's latest definitions,
    so using "all" is prone to failures until most Julia packages adopt the new
    definition.

    Valid values for each check are:
    - Individual checks:
      - `all_explicit_imports_are_public`,
      - `all_qualified_accesses_are_public`,
      - `all_explicit_imports_via_owners`,
      - `all_qualified_accesses_via_owners`,
      - `no_implicit_imports`,
      - `no_self_qualified_accesses`,
      - `no_stale_explicit_imports`
    - Select all checks: all
    - Exclude a check: prepend an individual check with 'exclude_'

    The selection logic is performed in the order given.
    If you pass only exclusions, it will assume that it starts from a complete list, and then excludes.
    If you pass any individual checks, it will assume that it starts from an empty list, and then includes.
    Passing both individual and exclusion checks does not make sense.
