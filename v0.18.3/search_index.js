If you have chosen the \"Recommended\" answers, or explicitly chose to add pre-commit, then you should use it now (see below).\n\nIf you need some help with undoing some of these changes, I recommend using a graphical interface for git.

This also doesn't explain where each file came from or why they are here. You can find some of that information in the Explanation section of the docs.\n\nPkgTemplates.jl, naturally. We used it for many years, and in particular for the initial TulipaEnergyModel.jl commit (see below).\nNetherlands eScience Center's python template includes many of the best practices that we apply here. We used many of the ideas there in a Julia context, and took many non-Julia specific ideas from there.\nTulipaEnergyModel.jl was the project that motivated this version of a template. From the start we decide to implement many best practices and so we started from a PkgTemplates.jl template and started adding parts of the python template that made sense.\nThe Julia Smooth Optimizers package ecosystem was one of the main motivations to look for a solution that could be applied and reapplied to existing packages, in particular to help maintainers.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Contributors","page":"BestieTemplate - Your best practices friend","title":"Contributors","text":"\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove
