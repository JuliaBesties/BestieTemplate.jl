### Niche

Please check the [MAINTAINERS](https://github.com/abelsiqueira/BestieTemplate.jl/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) file for the list of maintainers of the niche files.
If your issue involves one of these files, please ping the maintainer.

## Working on an issue

If you found an issue that interests you, comment on that issue what your plans are.
If the solution to the issue is clear, you can immediately create a pull request.
Otherwise, say what your proposed solution is and wait for a discussion around it.

!!! tip
    Feel free to ping us after a few days if there are no responses.

If your solution involves code (or something that requires running the package locally), check the [developer documentation](91-developer.md).
Otherwise, you can use the GitHub interface directly to create your pull request.
